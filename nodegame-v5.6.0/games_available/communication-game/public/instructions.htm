    <h3>Please read them carefully</h3>
    <div id="instructions">

		<p> This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making. You will
		earn money depending on the decisions you make.  Your earnings will be
		paid to you at the end of the experiment.  At the beginning of the
		experiment, you will be randomly paired with another human participant.
		You may have to wait some time for another MTurker to be recruited. You
		and your pair will then participate in the experiment, which consists
		of two steps.

		<p> We first describe the second step so that you know what decisions
		you will be making and how your earnings will be determined. Then we
		describe the first step of the experiment in which you can send a
		message to your pair.

		<p><b>Second Step</b>

		<p> In this step you and your pair will separately and independently
		select an option in secret. Both of you will only have two options to
		choose from: Option A and Option B. You and your pairâ€™s decisions will
		be combined. Based upon your combined decisions, you and your pair will
		be able to earn money. There are four possible situations: 

		<ul>
			<li>
				If both of you choose OPTION A, then both of you will earn $1.00.
			</li>
			<li> 
				If you choose OPTION A and your pair chooses OPTION B, then you
				will earn $0.20 and your pair will earn $0.90.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you choose OPTION B and your pair chooses OPTION A, then you
				will earn $0.90 and your pair will earn $0.20.
			</li>
			<li>
				If both of you choose OPTION 2, then both of you will earn $0.50.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Now, we describe the first step.

		<p><b>First Step</b>
		
		<p> In the first step, you and your pair will send a message to each
		other. Both of you can choose which message to send through a screen
		that looks like this. 

		<p><img src = "img/message_select.png">

		<p>You may be given the option to send additional messages. These
		additional messages, if any, will be added to the end of all the other
		messages to form one long message. Once both players have decided on
		their message, you will receive your pair's message and then proceed to
		the second step.
